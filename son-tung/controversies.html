				<h2> Controversies </h2>
				<p> Many of Son Tung M-TP songs composed and released during his high school years using beats and music arrangements that he downloaded from the internet. Because of that he was accused for violating the music copyrights. However this accusation was not persuasive to many people as these songs were not used for a commercial purpose and could be seen as his hobby, passion and learning process to be a songwriter. </p>
				<p> In June 2014, Son Tung M-TP faced a scandal about the commercial licence to use the beat for his first official release Em của ngày hôm qua ("You of Yesterday"). As the result, the song was withdrawn from all the music award nominations, music charts. His record company, Van Production, refused to take the responsibility and left him alone with all the criticism from the public and media. This supposedly was the reason he terminated the contract with his record label. The MV Em Cua Ngay Hom Qua was hidden on YouTube when it reached more than 40 million views. There is no official or legal claim has been made in relation to this allegation, however, it was suspectedly Van Production's injunction against Son Tung M-TP for his contract termination. The MV was re-published and still continuing to be viewed by million viewers from many different nationalities. Son Tung M-TP also made a remix and changed the song's beat and arrangement. </p>
				<p> In November 2014, his song for the movie Chang Trai Nam Ay, Chac Ai Do Se Ve ("Someone will come back") also was alleged to infringe the copyright of Jung Yong-hwa's song, . This allegation only ended when FNC Entertainment, Jung Yong-hwa's record label, informed that they considered the similarities between two songs but found no copyright infringements. </p>
